var lbsPerDay = 0.75
var daysPerMonth:Double = 30.0
doggyDiet = "\(dogName) eats \(lbsPerDay * daysPerMonth)lbs of dog food per month"

lbsPerDay = 0.25
dogName = "Lil Frankie"

//: ## More String

//: ### A String is an Array of Characters 
var password = "Meet me in St. Louis"

    if character == "e" {
        print("found an e!")
    } else {
        print("not found")

//: ## A String can be treated as an NSString

let newPassword = password.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString("e", withString: "3")
