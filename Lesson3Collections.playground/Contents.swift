//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play

import Cocoa

var str = "Hello, playground"

//Array- ordered list of items
//Dictionary- collection of key-value pairs
//Set- unordered list of distinct values

//: ### Initializing Arrays
//The verbose way
var numbers = Array<Double>()

//More common use
var moreNumbers = [Double]()
moreNumbers = [85.0, 90.0, 95.0]

//Array literal syntax
let differentNumbers = [97.5, 98.5, 99.0]
